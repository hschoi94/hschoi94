## Hi, I'm Hyeongseok

I build practical demos for color science, image processing, and container-native workflows. This page shows how you can lay out a simple bio, highlight your strengths, and point visitors to your work.

### What I do
- Research color spaces, tone mapping, and display pipelines.
- Prototype ML ideas with PyTorch and NumPy.
- Package reproducible environments with Docker/Podman.

### How to adapt
- Swap the bullet points for your focus areas.
- Add a portrait or banner image with Markdown: `![alt text](assets/profile.jpg)`.
- Mention your current role, education, or speaking engagements.
