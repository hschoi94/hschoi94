# Hyeongseok Choi

Welcome to a sample GitHub Pages setup that doubles as a lightweight personal site. Use this as a template for your own portfolio or research notebook.

- 🔗 Quick links: [About](about.md) · [Projects](projects.md) · [Notes](notes.md)
- 📫 Reach out via [email](mailto:hyeongseok@example.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyeongseok-choi).

## Highlights
- Color science, image processing, and ML experimentation.
- Shipping containerized workflows with GitHub Actions.
- Building reproducible demos for quick sharing.

## Recent Updates
- Added a structured About page and Projects gallery.
- Included a Notes page to draft posts or how-tos.
- Configured navigation links and social metadata.

## How to use this template
1. Fork the repository and enable GitHub Pages on the `main` branch with `/docs` or the project root.
2. Edit `_config.yml` to point `url` and `baseurl` to your repository settings.
3. Customize the sections on each page and add images or blog posts as needed.
